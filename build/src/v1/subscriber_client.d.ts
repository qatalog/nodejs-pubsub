     * to the [resource name format]

     * API requests, you must specify a name in the request.
     *
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.name
     *   Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format
     *   `"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}` must
     *   start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers
     *   (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),
     *   plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters
     *   in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`.
     * @param {string} request.topic
     *   Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving
     *   messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this
     *   field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.
     * @param {google.pubsub.v1.PushConfig} request.pushConfig
     *   If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is
     *   used to configure it. Either `pushConfig` or `bigQueryConfig` can be set,
     *   but not both. If both are empty, then the subscriber will pull and ack
     *   messages using API methods.
     * @param {google.pubsub.v1.BigQueryConfig} request.bigqueryConfig
     *   If delivery to BigQuery is used with this subscription, this field is
     *   used to configure it. Either `pushConfig` or `bigQueryConfig` can be set,
     *   but not both. If both are empty, then the subscriber will pull and ack
     *   messages using API methods.
     * @param {number} request.ackDeadlineSeconds
     *   The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for
     *   the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the
     *   interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it
     *   is considered to be <i>outstanding</i>. During that time period, the
     *   message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis).
     *
     *   For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack
     *   deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
     *   `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using
     *   non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a
     *   `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull.
     *   The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds.
     *   The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
     *   If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
     *
     *   For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for
     *   the call to the push endpoint.
     *
     *   If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub
     *   system will eventually redeliver the message.
     * @param {boolean} request.retainAckedMessages
     *   Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then
     *   messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are
     *   acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration`
     *   window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp]
     *   (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in
     *   the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
     * @param {google.protobuf.Duration} request.messageRetentionDuration
     *   How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog,
     *   from the moment a message is published.
     *   If `retain_acked_messages` is true, then this also configures the retention
     *   of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a `Seek`
     *   can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or less than 10
     *   minutes.
     * @param {number[]} request.labels
     *   See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels"> Creating and
     *   managing labels</a>.
     * @param {boolean} request.enableMessageOrdering
     *   If true, messages published with the same `ordering_key` in `PubsubMessage`
     *   will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which they
     *   are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in
     *   any order.
     * @param {google.pubsub.v1.ExpirationPolicy} request.expirationPolicy
     *   A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
     *   A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is
     *   successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
     *   operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set, a
     *   *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed
     *   value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   An expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter
     *   language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty,
     *   then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are
     *   delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered
     *   out.
     * @param {google.pubsub.v1.DeadLetterPolicy} request.deadLetterPolicy
     *   A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
     *   this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
     *   is disabled.
     *
     *   The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions's
     *   parent project (i.e.,
     *   service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
     *   permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
     * @param {google.pubsub.v1.RetryPolicy} request.retryPolicy
     *   A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this
     *   subscription.
     *
     *   If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies
     *   that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
     *   RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline
     *   exceeded events for a given message.
     * @param {boolean} request.detached
     *   Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached
     *   subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't retain any
     *   backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return
     *   FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to
     *   the endpoint will not be made.
     * @param {boolean} request.enableExactlyOnceDelivery
     *   If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery of
     *   a message with a given value of `message_id` on this subscription:
     *
     *   * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent
     *   before the message's acknowledgement deadline expires.
     *   * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.
     *
     *   Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message
     *   when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published
     *   multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are  considered distinct
     *   by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.
     * @param {google.protobuf.Duration} request.topicMessageRetentionDuration
     *   Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained
     *   after it is published to the subscription's topic. If this field is set,
     *   messages published to the subscription's topic in the last
     *   `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See
     *   the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only
     *   in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.
     * @param {google.pubsub.v1.Subscription.State} request.state
     *   Output only. An output-only field indicating whether or not the
     *   subscription can receive messages.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Promise} - The promise which resolves to an array.
